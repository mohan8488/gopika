      As a psychologist, completing the BrainRx certification program was an invaluable experience. The training provided me with a deeper understanding of how cognitive skills such as attention, memory, processing speed, and reasoning form the foundation for learning and performance. The combination of assessment tools, one-on-one training methods, and digital exercises gave me practical strategies I can now apply in my own practice. I feel equipped not only to identify cognitive weaknesses in clients but also to provide structured, evidence-based interventions that lead to measurable improvements. Becoming certified has expanded my professional toolkit and strengthened my confidence in helping individuals achieve lasting cognitive growth.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
