## **Privilege doesn’t just open doors.**

It rewires how we think, feel, and behave. It can dull empathy, inflate entitlement, and lead us to unconsciously hurt others — and ourselves.

### 🧠 Science backs this up:

- ✔️ **Reduced empathy** – Privilege lowers sensitivity to others’ pain ([Batson et al., 2007](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/2007-09405-006))  
- ✔️ **Entitlement schemas** – "I deserve more because I am more" (Young, Schema Therapy)  
- ✔️ **Moral licensing** – "I’ve done good, so I can act selfishly now" (Merritt et al., 2010)  
- ✔️ **In-group bias** – Unconscious favoritism toward those like us

### 🌍 Left unchecked, privilege can shape entire cultures:

- ⚠️ Workplace toxicity  
- ⚠️ Biased leadership  
- ⚠️ Disconnection  
- ⚠️ Erosion of trust  

> **Privilege, unchecked, becomes a public mental health issue.**

## A Personal Reflection

I grew up with privilege. But my parents raised me differently.

They never gave sermons about humility — they embodied it.

> *True respect doesn’t need applause.*  
> It’s how you speak to someone who can do nothing for you.  
> It’s greeting the doorman and the CEO with the same warmth.  
> It’s seeing dignity in everyone — not just in those who mirror your world.

One moment stuck with me for decades.

As a child, I once asked why we were taking a longer route home just to drop someone off.

They answered:

> **"Comfort is not something we protect just for ourselves."**

That sentence never left me.

## 🔧 So... How Do We Fix This?

- 🛠 **Cognitive restructuring** – Challenge superiority narratives  
- 🧠 **Perspective-taking** – Practice until it's automatic  
- 📉 **Shrink power distance** – Especially in leadership and policy  
- 🗣 **Safe feedback loops** – Make it easier to hear hard truths  
- 🧭 **Recenter on values** – Choose connection over comfort

## Ask Yourself:

> **"Where am I insulated from the consequences others face — and how has that shaped my behavior?"**

Privilege isn’t the villain.  
**Unexamined** privilege is.

Let’s build cultures that are aware, humble, and deeply human.

🙏 **To my parents**:  
*Thank you for teaching me that real strength whispers. It doesn’t shout.*
